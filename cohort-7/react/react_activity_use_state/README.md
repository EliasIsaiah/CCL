# Demonstrate your ability to `usestate`

## Standard Activity
### Tasks to complete (pick whichever you'd like but try to complete at least TWO)
* BREAK the make-me-a-burger-NOW react app so that there is an infinite loop caused by a useState state variable setter being called when the component is loaded to the page
* ENHANCE the make-me-a-burger-NOW react app by adding a new component, and rendering it in the `<App />` component
* ENHANCE the make-me-a-burger-NOW react app to change the background color of the application based off the color that the user has inputted
* Create a new state variable to keep track of how many times the color RED has been inputted. If number exceeds 10, place a fire truck emoji on the page

## Extra Activity
* re-write the text_styles_demo web application in React
