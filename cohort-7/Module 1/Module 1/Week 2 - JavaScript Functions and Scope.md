- [Arrow Functions](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

#### Topics
- Introduction to JavaScript functions and their syntax, including user interaction with dialog functions (`alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`).
- Understanding function scope, global scope, and block scope in JavaScript.
- Learning about ES6 features like arrow functions, `const`, and `let`.
- Best practices in writing clean and maintainable functions, including when to use return statements and when they are not needed.

#### Learning Goals
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
- [ ] Define and invoke JavaScript functions, understanding their purpose, use cases, and how to interact with users using `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm`.
- [ ] Distinguish between function scope, global scope, and block scope, and understand their implications in JavaScript.
- [ ] Utilize ES6 features to write more concise and efficient JavaScript code.
- [ ] Apply best practices in creating reusable and well-structured functions, understanding when to use return statements and when they are unnecessary for achieving desired outcomes.
