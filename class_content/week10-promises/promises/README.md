# Play around with the JSON Placeholder API!
## Challenges:
* retrieve data from the API and print it on the console
* retrieve data from the API and place it on the dom
* try making multiple fetch requests and use `Promise.all` to capture them all
* experiment with `Promise.race` to demonstrate how different promises may complete before others
* try out the `Promise.finally` method (which we didn't cover in lecutre) and try to understand what it does and what it is for
