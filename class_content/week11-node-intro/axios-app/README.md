# First Node.js application

## It's my fish's birthday! I want a node.js app that displays a happy birthday greeting when it runs!

* You must initialize a new node package using `npm init`. 
* You must use `server.js` as your entry point. 
* You must install at least 1 package
* You must display a message using `console.log`. It doesn't really have to be a birthday 🎂 message.
