# I want a secure password!

## You have been contracted by Kraft food to develop a password generator for their executives, because they keep using the same passwords and their facebook accounts are getting hacked.

Your password generator must accept the following parameters:
* 12 characters long
* 4 special characters

### Stretch goals:
* allow the user to choose how long the password is
* allow the user to choose how many special characters are in the password
* allow the user to choose whether the password contains uppercse or lowercase letters

### Super stretch goal:
* use character codes to generate the characters
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt
